# JavaScript30 Day 2

This repository contains the completed Day 2 challenge from the online course JavaScript30 by Wes Bos.

In this challenge a working clock is made using JavaScript and CSS. The clock's hands are accessed through the use of 'querySelector's and moved by getting the current time in seconds, minutes, and hours, then using those times to get an amount of rotational degrees to rotate the hands by.

The challenge has been completed in a more modern way than Wes Bos shows in his original tutorial. JavaScript modules are used to import and export functionality between files, resulting in cleaner code that is easier to make changes to. ES6 arrow functions are also used when possible in place of the function keyword.
